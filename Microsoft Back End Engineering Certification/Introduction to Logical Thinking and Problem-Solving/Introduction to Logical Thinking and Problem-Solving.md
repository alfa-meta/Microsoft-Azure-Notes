Logical Processes - the fundamental components that make up the code in programming languages.

Sequence - the simplest form of control structure where code is executed in a specific order.

Control Structures - statements that determine the flow of code execution based on specific conditions.

Iterations (Loops) - statements that enable a program to repeat a set of actions until a specific condition is met.

## Types of Logic Used in Programming

Boolean Logic - is the branch of logic that deals with true or false values.

Truth Value - whether an expression is true or false

AND Operator - result is true only if both expressions are true.
	If either expression is false or both expressions are false the result is false.

OR Operator - result is true if any of the two expressions are true
	If either expression is true or both expressions are true the result is true.

NOT Operator - negates the truth value of the expression.
	NOT true is false
	NOT false is true

IF Statements:
	Operates on one or more expressions
	Evaluates the truth value of the expressions
	Executes a block of code based on the result of the evaluation

Switch Statements:
	Operate on an expression that can have a variety of values
	Executes a block of code when a particular value is true
	Includes a default option in case none of the values is true

For Loops:
	Executes a block of code a specific number of times
	The number can be specified or a part of the variable

While Loops:
	Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
	Can be used with Boolean statements

## Practical Applications of Logical Processes

Flowchart - a diagram that represents a process that uses various shapes to show the application's logic and arrows to illustrate the paths users can take through the software

Pseudocode - a detailed and readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a natural language rather than in a programming language.
