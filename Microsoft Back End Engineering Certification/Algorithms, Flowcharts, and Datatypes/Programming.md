## Fundamental Data Types

Variables - a way to store data in a program.
Data Types - classifications of data in programming that define the type of value a variable can hold.

Integers:
- Used to store whole numbers
- Both positive and negative
- Do not include fractions or decimals
- Are used for counting and arithmetic operations

Double:
- Floating-point number
- Used for precise calculations involving precision

Strings:
- Sequences of characters used to represent text
- Include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces
- Numbers as strings cannot be used for calculations

Boolean:
- True or False statement


Type-safe Languages - are programming languages that enforce strict data type rules.

Non-type-safe Languages - are programming languages that are more flexible about data type rules than type-safe languages.

Function (Programming) - blocks of code designed to take input, process it, and return an output.
