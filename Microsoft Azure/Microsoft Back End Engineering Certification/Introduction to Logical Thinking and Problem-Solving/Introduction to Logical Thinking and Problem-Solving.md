Logical Processes - the fundamental components that make up the code in programming languages.

Sequence - the simplest form of control structure where code is executed in a specific order.

Control Structures - statements that determine the flow of code execution based on specific conditions.

Iterations (Loops) - statements that enable a program to repeat a set of actions until a specific condition is met.

## Types of Logic Used in Programming

Boolean Logic - is the branch of logic that deals with true or false values.

Truth Value - whether an expression is true or false

AND Operator - result is true only if both expressions are true.
	If either expression is false or both expressions are false the result is false.

OR Operator - result is true if any of the two expressions are true
	If either expression is true or both expressions are true the result is true.

NOT Operator - negates the truth value of the expression.
	NOT true is false
	NOT false is true

IF Statements:
	Operates on one or more expressions
	Evaluates the truth value of the expressions
	Executes a block of code based on the result of the evaluation

Switch Statements:
	Operate on an expression that can have a variety of values
	Executes a block of code when a particular value is true
	Includes a default option in case none of the values is true

For Loops:
	Executes a block of code a specific number of times
	The number can be specified or a part of the variable

While Loops:
	Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
	Can be used with Boolean statements

## Practical Applications of Logical Processes

Flowchart - a diagram that represents a process that uses various shapes to show the application's logic and arrows to illustrate the paths users can take through the software

Pseudocode - a detailed and readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a natural language rather than in a programming language.


## Deductive Reasoning in Programming

Deductive Reasoning - a logical process by which conclusions are drawn from given premises.

Process of Deductive Reasoning:
- Start with the observed issue
- Develop premises
- Draw conclusions
- Pinpoint the problem


Arguments in Logic:
1. Premises
2. Conclusion
3. Supporting relation

Crafting Good Premises:
1. Premises should be clear
2. Premises should be factual
3. Premises should be directly related to the issue

Find direct cause and effect relations.

### Steps for Applying Deductive Reasoning

1. Identify the premises - gather all known facts or assumptions that provide the foundation for reasoning.
2. Analyse the premises - examine how these premises relate to each other and what logical conclusions can be drawn.
3. Draw a conclusion - based on analysis, derive a logical conclusion.
4. Test the conclusion - verify the conclusion by reviewing the code, checking logs, or conducting further tests.


## Problem Decomposition

Problem Decomposition - the process of breaking down a problem into a small manageable parts.

Steps to Decompose Software:
1. Identify the problem goal
2. Break it down into parts
3. Analyse and address
4. Integrate the solution

Top-Down Approach - a method of problem-solving that begins with a broad overview of a problem and breaks it down into a smaller, more manageable parts.

Modularisation - a decomposition approach where you fragment a complex issue into smaller, independent parts that each carry out a specific role.
	Break the problem into units or modules
	Modules perform a specific function
	Simplifies management and understanding

Create a broad design goal or problem statement
State goals and problems that are out of scope

Implementing the Top-Down Approach for Debugging:
- Identify the broad issue
- Create specific tasks that might lead to the cause
- Isolate the issue
- Fix the issue


Bottom-Up Approach - a method of problem-solving that begins with small, manageable parts and combines them to create a broad composite.

Integration - the process of combining parts of a problem or design into a complete, composite, and unified whole.


## Introduction to Pseudocode

Pseudocode - a detailed and readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a natural language rather than in a programming language.


### How is Pseudocode used
- Bridge between natural language and programming code
- Outline the program's logic
- Verify the logic is correct.


### Writing Pseudocode
- Use plain language
- Being Concise
- Structure like code
- Focus on logic
