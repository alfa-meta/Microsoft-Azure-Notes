## Front-End
Part of the application that runs on the users device.
Includes Text, Images, Buttons and Forms

Limitations:
- Performance
- Security
- Data Handling


## Back-End 
Servers - computers that receive requests, process data and send a response.

Back-End - part of the application that runs on the server.
	Manages connections with databases
	Processes requests
	Ensures that everything functions smoothly

Back-End Development - is the practice of building and managing systems that power apps and websites, such as data processing, storage, and application logic.

Backend Dev is focused on:
	Servers
	Databases
	APIs

Servers - powerful computers that store data and run software needed to show web pages or applications.

Server Side Scripting - involves code that runs on the server and not the browser.

Database - a tool to store, organise, and manage data efficiently.
Database Management - ensures data can be accessed, updated, and retrieved quickly.

API Integration - the process of connecting two or more applications using APIs.

Data - information that is collected, stored, and used by computers, often in the form of text, numbers, or other formats, to drive decisions and operations in various applications.

### Core Principles of Back-End Development
- Performance
	- Write efficient code
	- Monitor and manage server resources
- Scalability
- Security
	- Data handling
	- Access control
- Reliability

Performance - how quickly and efficiently the site or application responds to user requests.

Scalability - ensures a website or application can grow and handle more users, data and processes.

Security - Protect sensitive data, maintain user trust and comply with legal regulations.

Reliability - the ability of a system to function correctly and consistently over time

Resources - computational power, memory, storage, and network bandwidth that a server uses to perform tasks and run applications.
### Error Handling and Reliability
A reliable back-end system gracefully handles errors, logs issues for troubleshooting, and ensures that services remain available even during failures.

Robust error handling prevents system crashes, and detailed logging helps diagnose issues, ensuring the system runs smoothly and consistently over time.

Error Handling - the process of detecting and managing errors to prevent them from disrupting the system.

Version control systems - software tools that record changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
	Benefits:
		1. Store all the assets the team produces
		2. Track code changes
		3. Revert to previous versions of their code

Source Control Integration - the process of combining code changes from multiple developers into a shared project repository, ensuring that these changes work together correctly.

Build - the process of transforming source code into an independent program that is ready to be deployed on a server.

Deployment - the process of taking code that's been integrated, tested, and built, and installing it into a production environment where users can access it.


Integration Involves:
- Merging Code
- Testing
- Building

CI/CD Pipelines - automate the integration, and deployment of code, ensuring that new changes are quickly and reliably delivered to users.

### Choosing the Integration Method:

Native Integrations - many project planning tools offer built-in integrations with other software, allowing direct connections without additional coding.
	Jira can integrate with IDEs

Middleware tools - middleware tools like Microsoft BizTalk enable communication between systems that lack direct integrations, acting as intermediaries to bridge gaps between different applications.

Custom APIs - custom APIs provide a tailored solution for specific needs.
	Most control
	Most effort to develop and maintain


### Automating Processes

Integrations can automate routine processes.
Committing code to a version control system can automatically update task statuses or trigger tests.
