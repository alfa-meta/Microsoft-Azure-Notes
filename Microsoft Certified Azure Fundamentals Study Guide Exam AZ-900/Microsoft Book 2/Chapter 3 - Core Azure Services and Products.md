### Azure Compute Services

Virtual Machines (VMs) - fundamental compute service, offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Azure App Services - fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications quickly and efficiently.
	Support many frameworks.
	Includes auto-scaling, integrated performance monitoring, and security.

Azure Functions - serverless compute option for developers to run event-driven pieces of code without explicitly provisioning or managing infrastructure.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - managed Kubernetes environments, making it easier to deploy, manage and scale containerised applications using Kubernetes on Azure.


### Azure Storage Solutions

Azure Blob Storage - designed to store massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text and binary data.
	Highly scalable and secure service.

Azure Files - service offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
	Optimised for migrating legacy applications.

Azure Queues - messaging store for reliable messaging between application components, whether they run in the cloud, on the desktop.
	Durable queuing system for asynchronous tasks.

Azure Table Storage - NoSQL data store for semi-structured data. 
	Used for storing flexible datasets like user data for web applications.

### Azure Networking Capabilities

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) - enables Azure resources like VMs to securely communicate with each other.

Azure ExpressRoute - provides a private connection between an on-premise organisation infrastructure and Microsoft Azure.

Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) - service stores cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations closer to end-users, to minimise latency.

### Azure Database Services

Azure SQL Database - a fully managed relational database with auto-scale.
	Allows users to migrate their SQL Server workloads to the cloud with minimal changes.

Azure Cosmos DB - globally distributed, multi-model database service that enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions.

Azure Database for MySQL - fully managed, scalable MySQL relational database with high availability and security built into the service.

### Additional Core Services

Azure Marketplace - an online store that offers applications and services either built on or designed to integrate with Azure's platform.

Azure Active Directory (AAD) - Microsoft's multi-tenant, cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory services.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) - deployment and management service for Azure, providing a management layer that enable you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.

Azure Monitor - a comprehensive solution for collecting, analysing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.



## Azure Compute Options

Virtual Machines (VMs):
	On-demand scalability.
	Variety of options - wide selection of VM sizes and images for various use cases.
	 Windows and Linux support.
	 Great for migrating existing applications to the cloud.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
	Managed Kubernetes service, reduced complexity of by offloading much of that responsibility.
	Integrated developer tools - seamlessly integrate with Azure DevOps, Visual Studio Code, and other tools to simplify the workflow.
	Microservices-ready: AKS is ideal for microservices  architectures due to its high levels of scalability and flexibility.
