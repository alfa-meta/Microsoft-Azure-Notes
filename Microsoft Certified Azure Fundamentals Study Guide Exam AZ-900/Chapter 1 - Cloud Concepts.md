Microsoft currently offers three cloud computing solutions:
	Microsoft Azure
	Microsoft 365
	Microsoft Dynamics 365

Microsoft 365 - geared primarily toward providing end-user SaaS solutions. Such as:
	Windows
	Office
	SharePoint
	OneDrive

Microsoft Dynamics 365 - encompasses enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management applications.

## 1. Benefits of Cloud Computing

### 1.1 Economic Benefits

Capital Expenditure (CapEx) - money spent by an organisation to acquire or maintain fixed assets.
	Includes buying IT infrastructure such as servers.

Operation Expenditure (OpEx) - monthly expenditures that the organization uses to run its operation.

Moving from CapEx to OpEx allows:
	Elimination of up-front costs
	The organisation to spread costs over a year rather than in bulk.
	Ties costs to headcount.

Economy of Scale - cloud provider can purchase large amounts of hardware at a discount and pass that discount along to its customers.
### 1.2 Scalability and Elasticity

Scalability - is the ability to add computing resources to adjust to increased demand.

Horizontal scaling - adds additional resources when needed and removes them when they are no longer needed.

Vertical scaling - adjusts the capacity of existing resources to accommodate demand changes.

Elasticity - automatic scaling of cloud resources.

### 1.3 High Availability

High Availability - describes a system that is available for use without significant outages and that is generally backed by a service level agreement (SLA). 

### 1.4 Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance - describes a characteristic of a system that enables it to continue functioning when one or more components of the system fails.
	Happens at a component level.

In order for web servers to be fault tolerant, you add a another web server and use a load balancer between them
### 1.5 Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery - refers to the process of recovering from a situation where multiple systems or services fail.

## 2. Cloud Computing Models and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Software-as-a-Service

Software as a Service (SaaS) - is a licensing model in which an organization licenses software on a subscription basis from a provider that centrally manages and distributes the software.

Benefits of SaaS:
	Operational Expense - moving operation capex to opex by licensing software per use basis.
	Updates - provider generally updates the software periodically.
	Deployment and manageability - you do not need to deploy or manage software with a SaaS offering.
### 2.2 Infrastructure-as-a-Service

Infrastructure as a Service - enables you to deploy and use infrastructure components in Azure.

Examples include:
	Virtualisation - deploying virtual servers

### 2.3 Platform-as-a-Service

Platform as a Service (PaaS) - the ability to quickly develop and deploy without the need to manage underlying servers, operating systems, and other resources.

Azure SQL Database can also be a component of PaaS and SaaS.

### 2.4 Shared Responsibility

## 3. Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud Models

### 3.1 Public Cloud

Public Cloud - is one in which the services offered in the cloud are available for public use over the internet.

### 3.2 Private Cloud

Private Cloud - cloud serves a single organisation, whether hosted in your own data centre or by someone else

### 3.3 Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid Cloud - is one in which an organisation integrates on-premises services with cloud-hosted services, whether in a public or private cloud.
